# Quantum Cryptographic Key Exchange

A small project demonstrating two approaches to produce a shared key between two parties:

Task 1 — BB84 QKD prototype (simulation) using Qiskit (classical simulation or IBM backends).

Task 1 — Post-Quantum KEM prototype using liboqs / Kyber (classical, post-quantum KEM).

Goal: a reproducible shared key (byte string / hex) that both parties derive at the end of the exchange.
